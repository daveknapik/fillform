Description:

Fillform is a simple command line utility that automatically completes lead forms on our site with a set of standard test data. Its purpose is to save time when browser testing.

---

Usage as a Ruby script:

1. First you must have Ruby 1.9 or higher installed on your system

2. You must also get the firewatir gem (http://code.google.com/p/firewatir/) and install the associated firewatir Firefox plugin.

3. Firefox must be opened from the command line with the -jssh flag set, like this:

/Applications/Firefox.app/Contents/MacOS/firefox-bin -jssh

4. Now you can autocomplete forms, for example: ruby bin/fillform http://www.nl.edu/wisconsin/learnmore.cfm

or, the same example that doesn't submit the form: ruby bin/fillform -nosubmit http://www.nl.edu/wisconsin/learnmore.cfm

Usage as a Ruby gem

Follow steps 1-3 above, then install the latest gem version inside fillform/pkg. Once the gem has been installed, you can call it like so:

fillform  http://www.nl.edu/wisconsin/learnmore.cfm
fillform -nosubmit http://www.nl.edu/wisconsin/learnmore.cfm
